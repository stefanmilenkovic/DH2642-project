# BikeApp
## Purpose of this project
This project is part of the 2017 'DH2642-Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web' at the Royal Institute of Techonology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.

## About the project
We have created an online reporting system for cyclists in Seattle. This system allows to mark on the map issues that cyclists commonly find on the road:
* 'Hazards'
* 'Potholes'
* 'Damage'
* 'Theft'

Using the open data from the [City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov) we collect the position of all the bike racks in the city and place markers on the map.
